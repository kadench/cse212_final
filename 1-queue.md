# **Introduction | Queues**

What is a **queue**? In Python, a **queue** is used to execute multiple items, one at a time, in the order they arrived. This methodology is referred to as `FIFO`, or `First in, First Out`. This can quickly be visualized through the example hot dog line list below:

### **Queue Example:**

```python
# exit                                                                    # enter 
dequeue <-- hot_dog_vendor_line = [':)', 'o/', ':]', '(:', '[:', '\o'] <-- enqueue
```
`:)` is first in line, which means he gets the first hot dog. Then, `:)` leaves and everyone else in line moves up one.
