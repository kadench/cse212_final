# **Queues**

What is a **queue**? In Python, a **queue** is used to execute multiple items, one at a time, in the order they arrived. This methodology is referred to as `FIFO`, or `First in, First Out`. This can quickly be visualized through a line of emojis. Each of them are patiently waiting their turn for a hot dog:

### **Queue Example:**

```python
   # exit                                               # enter 
c|:] dequeue <-- [':)', 'o/', ':]', '(:', '[:', '\o'] <-- enqueue
```
`:)` is first in line, which means he gets the first hot dog. Then, `:)` leaves and everyone else in line moves up one. It's exactly like how a line works in real life.

### Common Methods Used in a Queue:
| Function        | Definition                                | Performance |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
| `.enqueue(item)` | Add an item to the back of the queue.    | **O(1)**        |
| `.dequeue()`     | Remove the first item from the queue.    | **O(1)**        |
| `.empty()`       | Checks if the queue is empty.            | **O(1)**        |
| `.front()`       | Returns a copy of the first item in the queue. | **O(1)**      |
| `.rear()`        | Returns a copy of the last item in the queue. | **O(1)**      |
| `.size()`        | Returns the size of the list as a number. | **O(1)**       |




## Queue Operations

### Accessing Data in the Queue
Even though a queue has similar structure to a list, some things are different. When we want to retrieve data from a list in python, we can just set a certain index to a variable. Doing so allows us to use it later:

```python
foods = ['egg', 'salad', 'sandwich'] # make a list
eaten_food = my_list[2] # set list item to the lunch variable
print(f"I had {eaten_food} for lunch") # print the variable in a sentence
```


## Modifying Data in the Queue

### Adding an Item to the Queue

#### Enqueue

### Deleting an Item from the Queue

#### Dequeue
