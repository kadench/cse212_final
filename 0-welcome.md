## Introduction | Big O Notation or (O)n
When I first started this class, I had no idea what **Big O notation**, or **(O)n**, was. If you're like me, you'd probably need an introduction. **Big O Notation** is a mathematical representation of the amount of time or space a certain function will take to complete a certain task. There are many ways to complete a task with code, but it's the efficiently built ways that will take your code to the next level. As a class, we were told to graph different the lines that certain functions made. This makes it easier to visualize how much effort a function has to do to complete a task. I recommend you do the same as it will help you too. You can find common **(O)n** equations online.
