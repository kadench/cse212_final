## **Introduction**
What is a **tree**? In Python, a tree is a data structure that is used to store related and measurable data. For example, numbers have a measurable value. When storing numbers by their value in a **tree**, we find the **root** value, or the beginning of the tree. In the case of numbers, it's the number that will allow the most connections down in the line. The middle ground if you will. An easy way to visualize or see a tree in action is to look at your family tree. Each person is considered a **node** or an item that relates to the previous item in the tree:

A family tree is a bit different from a normal tree, but from the example above, we can pretend that the top most people (represented with gray diamonds) can be seen as the **root** or the beginning of that specific tree. Each person (or **node**) has an individual place in the tree. The root connects the **subtree** or their children's children. The **leaves** of a tree (the green diamonds) are at the end of the tree and cannot become a subtree as they are not connected to further things down the line.
